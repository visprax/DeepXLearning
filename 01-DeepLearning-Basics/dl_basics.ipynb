    "\n",
    "*Supervised Learning* is an approach in machine learning where we have a *labeled* dataset, meaning that each data point consists of certain *features* and a corresponding label. These datasets are designed to supervise learning algorthims is to deduce a function that maps these input feature vectors to output labels. In supervised learning, unlike unsupervised one, we have a *ground truth*, meaning that we know what outputs will be for certain input samples. We use *feature extraction* techniques to best describe the raw data using the features that would be useful for our predictive model, e.g. the RGB values of an image. Sometimes these extracted features could not best represent the data for our model, and instead we engineer other features from existing ones, this process is called *feature engineering*, for example we use acceleration derived from velocity as a function of time, or use the log of a feature instead of the actual feature itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is identified by the lack of ground truth, the algorithms do not take labeled input, but the goal is to infer the inherint structures present in the dataset, and to do an explotary analysis. The output could be in many forms, such as features in an image, or most commonly, clusters in the data.\\\n",
    "*Dimensionality reduction* is a key technique within unsupervised learning. Often times working in high-dimensional spaces is complex and unpleasant, its computatinoally expensive, or the data is sparse. Dimensionality reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space (many distinctive features or independent variables) into a low-dimensional space, such that it retains intrinsic characteristics of the original data. Dimensionality reduction enables us to reduce noise and redundancy in the dataset and find an approximate version of the dataset using fewer features.\n",
