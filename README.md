# DeepXLearning
Learn Deep Learning from scratch by doing practical projects and implementing different neural networks from the ground up.


- notebooks explaining different deep learning algorithms with examples, e.g. using pytorch.
- concepts dir is where we explore different algos and concepts, at the end of each concept give the link for related projects.
- projects is where we have different projects implemented probably using different frameworks but mostly using pytorch.
- Each project should contain concepts, explanations separately from the project itself.
